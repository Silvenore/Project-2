# Red vs Blue
In this project I played as both the pentester and the SOC analyst. 
My goal as the pentester was to gain access to a vulnerable machine by using the following steps:

-Identifying the IP address and exposed services of the target VM.
-Finding hidden files on the target.  
-Brute-forcing and cracking passwords to gain entry.  
-Uploading a PHP reverse shell to an insecure web server. 
-Exploring the target system and finding the flag.  

My goal as the SOC analyst was to find evidence of the pentesting attempts through logs on Kibana.
